# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

* Medium
*   Given an integer `n`, return _the number of structurally unique **BST'**s (binary search trees) which has exactly_ `n` _nodes of unique values from_ `1` _to_ `n`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: n = 3
    </strong><strong>Output: 5
    </strong></code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: n = 1
    </strong><strong>Output: 1
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

Just as the question stated, for a tree of n nodes, there is a specifc number of possible BSTs, no matter what those n nodes are exactly. (Assuming no duplicates) Next, we observe that when we choose a node i to be the root, on the left subtree we have a smaller problem with i-1 nodes, and on the right we have another smaller problem with n-i nodes. Therefore a recursion solution seems plausible. And to make sure it works, the edge cases happens when there is 0 or 1 node to be placed, which, in both cases, contributes 1 possible tree. &#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return 1;
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
            ans += numTrees(i-1) * numTrees(n-i);
        return ans;
    }
};

```
