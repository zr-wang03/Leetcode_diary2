# 97. Interleaving String

* Medium
*   Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

    An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m`&#x20;

    substrings respectively, such that:

    * `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
    * `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
    * `|n - m| <= 1`
    * The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

    **Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/02/interleave.jpg)

    <pre><code><strong>Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
    </strong><strong>Output: true
    </strong><strong>Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
    </strong>Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
    Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
    Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
    </code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
    </strong><strong>Output: false
    </strong><strong>Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution

A dp solution is as follows. The idea is like finding a path from the top left to the down right in the basic finding a path problem.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
     bool isInterleave(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
        if(s3.length() != s1.length() + s2.length())
            return false;
        
        bool table[s1.length()+1][s2.length()+1];
        
        for(int i=0; i<s1.length()+1; i++)
            for(int j=0; j< s2.length()+1; j++){
                if(i==0 && j==0)
                    table[i][j] = true;
                else if(i == 0)
                    table[i][j] = ( table[i][j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1]);
                else if(j == 0)
                    table[i][j] = ( table[i-1][j] && s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]);
                else
                    table[i][j] = (table[i-1][j] && s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1] ) || (table[i][j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1] );
            }
            
        return table[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }
};
```
