# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

* Medium
*   You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)

    <pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
    </strong><strong>Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
    </strong><strong>Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
    </strong></code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg)

    <pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
    </strong><strong>Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
    </strong><strong>Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 &#x3C; 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution: In order traversal

All we need is an in order traversal to find to numbers that are wrong. The first one will be larger than its following number, and the second one will be smaller than its previous number. The rest of the list will be in order.

```
class Solution {
public:
	TreeNode* firstMistake, *secondMistake, *pre;
	void recoverTree(TreeNode* root) {
		pre = new TreeNode(INT_MIN);
		inorder(root);
		swap(firstMistake->val, secondMistake->val);
	}

	void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
		if(root == nullptr) 
			return;

		inorder(root->left);

		if(firstMistake == nullptr && root->val < pre->val)
			firstMistake = pre;
		if(firstMistake != nullptr && root->val < pre->val)
			secondMistake = root;
		pre = root;

		inorder(root->right);
	}
};
```
