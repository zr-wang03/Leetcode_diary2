# 88. Merge Sorted Array

* Easy
*   You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

    **Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

    The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
    </strong><strong>Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
    </strong>The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
    </code></pre>

### Solution - Reverse Sorting

To avoid creating many temp holders, we can sort the nums1 array from the back to the end. That way, we just have to keep three pointers indicating where we are in nums1, nums2 and the resulting nums1.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int i = m-1;
        int j =n-1;
        int tar = n+m-1;
        
        while (j >=0){
            if (i>=0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j]){
                nums1[tar] = nums1[i];
                tar -=1;
                i -=1;
            }
            else{
                nums1[tar] = nums2[j];
                tar -=1;
                j -=1;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
