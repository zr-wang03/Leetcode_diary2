# 89. Gray Code

* Medium
*   An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

    * Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2n - 1]`,
    * The first integer is `0`,
    * An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
    * The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**, and
    * The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

    Given an integer `n`, return _any valid **n-bit gray code sequence**_.

### Solution

(This gray code looks like the sequence we use when building k-map)

The key in the solution is that every n bit gray code can be built using the n-1 bit gray code.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> result;
        result.push_back(0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int prevLength = result.size();
            int mask = 1 << (i - 1);
            for (int j = prevLength - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                result.push_back(mask + result[j]);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
