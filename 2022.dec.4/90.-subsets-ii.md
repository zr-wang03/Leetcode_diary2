# 90. Subsets II

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return _all possible_ _subsets (the power set)_.

    The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,2,2]
    </strong><strong>Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution - Backtracking

The problem is not much different from "Subset I". The only thing to notice is that there are duplicates in the nums array. So we need to skip those duplicates unless we want it to appear multiple times in the answer.&#x20;

For example, in \[1,2,2]. If we have \[1], we can only push the first 2 into it to form \[1,2] but not push the second 2 into it to form another \[1,2]. The only case we want the second one in is when we push it into \[1,2] to form \[1,2,2].

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int> > subsetsWithDup(vector<int> &nums) {
		sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        vector<vector<int> > res;
		vector<int> vec;
		subsetsWithDup(res, nums, vec, 0);
		return res;
    }
private:
	void subsetsWithDup(vector<vector<int> > &res, vector<int> &nums, vector<int> &vec, int begin) {
		res.push_back(vec);
		for (int i = begin; i != nums.size(); ++i)
			if (i == begin || nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) { 
				vec.push_back(nums[i]);
				subsetsWithDup(res, nums, vec, i + 1);
				vec.pop_back();
			}
	}
};
```
