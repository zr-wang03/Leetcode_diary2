# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

* Hard
*   Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return _the modified list_.

    `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

    You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
*   **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse\_ex1.jpg)

    <pre><code>Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [2,1,4,3,5]</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse\_ex2.jpg)

    <pre><code>Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [3,2,1,4,5]</code></pre>



### Solution&#x20;

Let's just look at k nodes for a start. Say for example our given problem is example 2 above, then we look at 1->2->3 at first. What we want to do is to take 1->2->3 and change it to 1<- 2<- 3, which looks like every node is pointing to its "previous" node(if there is such a definition). So what we need to do is to create this previous ptr. The process will look somewhat like this:

1 -> 2 -> 3     =>     null <- 1 - 2 -> 3     =>     null <- 1 <- 2 - 3     =>     null <- 1 <- 2 <- 3&#x20;

Looking at the bigger picture, we can do the above recursively by dealing with k nodes at a time. We should also add a cycle to count if there are more than k left for us to do such a reverse, if not, then we just return without modifying anything.&#x20;

        for (int i=0;i<k;i++){
            if (!traverse){
                return head;
            }
            traverse=traverse->next;
        }
        ListNode* curr=head;
        ListNode* prev=nullptr;
        ListNode* nxt=nullptr;
        for (int i=0;i<k;i++){
            nxt=curr->next;
            curr->next=prev;
            prev=curr;
            curr=nxt;
        }
        head->next=reverseKGroup(curr,k);
        return prev;
    }
};
```
