# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

* Medium
*   Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 0
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
    The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code>Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> -1
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.</code></pre>



### Solution 1 - Brute force

```
class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        int m=haystack.size();
        int n=needle.size();
        for (int i=0;i<m-n+1;i++){
            int j=0;
            while (j<n && haystack[i+j]==needle[j]){
                j++;
            }
            if (j==n){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```



### Solution 2 - KMP

For the definition for KMP, check the following website: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/.  ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/)Put short, the basic idea behind KMP is that when we compare a subset of the string and it failed to match in the end, we should make use of the fact that some part of it actually matched.  Which means that if we have the correct help, we might use that information to skip a few steps in the next comparison.

In order to do that, we also need a helping array that tells us how far ahead can we skip. What it does is, in the ith place, it looks at a sub-string of the orignal string of length i and record the length of the longest matching proper prefix and suffix.&#x20;

( Definition of prefix and suffix are as follows:

Proper prefix: a substring starting from the start of a string excluding the whole string. Example: for the word "prefix", its proper prefixes are "" , "p" , "pr" , "pre" , "pref" , "prefi". Note that "prefix" itself is not a proper prefix.&#x20;

Proper suffix: similarly, a proper suffix is a substring from the end of a string excluding the whole string. For the word "suffix", its proper suffixes are "" , "x" , "ix" , "fix" , "ffix" , "uffix".  )

So how does that help? Say we are matching:&#x20;

```
bacbababaabcbab
    |||||
    abababca
```

We have a partial match, and we would like to see how many of the string are guranteed to be matching, which means where is the next place we have to check if it matches. We look at the partial matched part "ababa" and we know the "length of the longest matching proper prefix and suffix" (calculate ahead) is 3, meaning "aba" and "aba" are the same. Now we can skip two places and make the suffix "aba" become now the new prefix in the new substring we are looking at. As follows:&#x20;

```
// x denotes a skip
bacbababaabcbab
    xx|||
      abababca
```

So that is why it is useful. To get another prespective, check out the following blog [http://jakeboxer.com/blog/2009/12/13/the-knuth-morris-pratt-algorithm-in-my-own-words/](http://jakeboxer.com/blog/2009/12/13/the-knuth-morris-pratt-algorithm-in-my-own-words/). Ok, now let us implement this.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        int m = haystack.size(), n = needle.size();
        if (!n) {
            return 0;
        }
        vector<int> lps = kmpProcess(needle);
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < m;) {
            if (haystack[i] == needle[j]) { 
                i++, j++;
            }
            if (j == n) {
                return i - j;
            }
            if (i < m && haystack[i] != needle[j]) {
                if (j==0){
                    i++;
                }else{
                    j = lps[j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
private:
    vector<int> kmpProcess(string needle) {
        int n = needle.size();
        vector<int> lps(n, 0);
        for (int i = 1, len = 0; i < n;) {
            if (needle[i] == needle[len]) {
                lps[i++] = ++len;
            } else if (len) {
                len = lps[len - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i++] = 0;
            }
        }
        return lps;
    }
};
```
