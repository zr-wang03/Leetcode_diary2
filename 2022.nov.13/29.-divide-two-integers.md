# 29. Divide Two Integers

* Medium&#x20;
* Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
* The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.
* Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

### Solution - Bitwise

The naive way to think is to use the definition of division: we just keep subtracting divisior from the dividend until we can't subtract anymore. The problem with this is that it runs in to "time limit exceeds" errors as there are testcases like ( 2^31-1 , 1 ). So how can we make it faster? Without using multiplication, what we have left is left-shift. This is the only way to make it grow exponentially so as not to run overtime. Left-shift is like multiplying by two. So what we do is to keep left-shifting right before the time when dividend is smaller than the divisor and we subtract it and re-iterate.

The process above reminds me of converting decimal to binary, and basically what we are doing is to build up the quotient in binary form.&#x20;

class Solution {
public:
    int divide(int A, int B) {
        if (A == INT_MIN && B == -1) return INT_MAX;
        long a = abs(A);
        long b = abs(B);
        long res = 0;
        int x = 0;
        while (a - b >= 0) {
            x=0;
            while (a - (b << x << 1) >= 0){
                x++;
            }
            res += 1 << x;
            a -= b << x;
        }
        
        return (A > 0) == (B > 0) ? res : -res;
    }
};
