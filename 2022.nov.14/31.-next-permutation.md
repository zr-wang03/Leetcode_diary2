# 31. Next Permutation

* Medium
*   A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    * For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

    The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    * For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
    * Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
    * While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

    Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

### Solution&#x20;

(Before you read the following, remind yourself how you would add 1 to 99 to get 100, what is the carryon in this computation and how you set the ones after the carryon digit.)

Consider the case of four numbers:

1234 => 1243 => 1324 => 1342 => 1423 => 1432 => 2134 => 2143 => ....

You should have noticed that in the first four permutations we have a fixed 1 in the front, and for the first two permutations we have a fixed 2 in the second place. So what we want from permutations is actually try to hold as many numbers fixed from the most significant digit and alter the sequence in the later ones.&#x20;

For example, we want to go to the next state from 1234. We can have 12 fixed and turn 34 into 43. For the next step, we cannot have another variation of the two digits 34 so we are also taking 2 into account, changing 243 to 324. This action looks like a carry-on in a counter. And the carry-on digit is the key to this problem.&#x20;

When do we know we cannot have more permutations with several numbers? When they are listed in descending order, like 4321. When we try to increase it by one, we have to do carry-on. Therefore to find the carry-on digit, we would be looking from the back of the list for the place where the number is not increasing.&#x20;

Take the sequence 645321 as example .&#x20;

we can see 2>1, 3>2, 5>3 but not 4>5. Therefore 5321 is the largest permutation we can represent with these four digits and we need to carry on to the place of 4. So when carry-on, what is the value we take to replace 4? 5, right? 5 is the smallest number in the four digits that is larger than 4. But if the search is conducted this way to we would have to go through the whole 4 digits once. Wouldn't be too costy now but what if the number is longer? What we can do to improve this is that we know the digits after 4 are in decreasing order(since when we look from the back they are ascending order), so if we go from the back again, we are guaranteed that the first value we found larger than 4 is also the "smallest number in the four digits that is larger than 4". &#x20;

Now we can swap 4 and 5 and get 654321.

So what's next? We want to "reset" the digits after 5 to the smallest combination, just like when you add 1 to 999 you carry on 1 and set the three digits to 000 to get 1+999=1000. You might notice that 4321 happens to be in strict descending order, therefore what we need to do is just to reverse it to make it 1234 and there we have our final answer:&#x20;

651234\.

But, is this just coincidence? We are guaranteed that the values are in descending order except for the 4 that has come in to replace 5. But that 4 must also keep the order, why? When we find 5, we are looking for the first value from the back that is larger than 4, therefore any digit after 5 will be less than 4. We also know that the values before 5 are larger than 5 because the digits are in ascending order viewing from the back. Therefore we are certain that 4 is fitting into the descending order so we just need to reverse all the digits after the 5. (which is now in the place of the old 4.)
