# 32. Longest Valid Parentheses

* Hard
*   Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, return _the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: s = "(()"
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 2
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code>Input: s = ")()())"
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 4
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".</code></pre>

### Solution - Stack

The stack used in this solution is used to record where a potential can be. The top of the stack is the index of the last "(" we saw that is still to be matched, or it is some left-over ")". By finding a new ")" to remove it, either we get an empty stack meaning that we have just got ourselves another redundant ")" to match, so we add its back to denote the earliest place a new valid match can be. (The left-over ")" cannot be matched but the parentheses right after it might still be matched in the future, by recording the index of the ")" instead of what follows, we are saving ourselves from the work of end-begin+1 when calculating the length.) On the other hand, if the stack is not empty after that, the new top is the last thing unmatched before the () we have just matched. In the second case, it means that from that index all the way to the index we are at now are valid parentheses. Therefore we can calculate the length and compare it with the maximum.&#x20;
