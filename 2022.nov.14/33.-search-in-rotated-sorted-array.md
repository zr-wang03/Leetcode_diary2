# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

* Medium
*   There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

    Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

    Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

### Solution

We cannot do regular binary search because it is not strictly sorted. However if we look at the place of the rotation, the sub-array to the left as well as the sub-array to the right are sorted. Therefore we just need subtle changes to binary search to make this work. Besides comparing with  the mid, we would also have to check which side the target is on.&#x20;

class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        if(nums.empty()||nums.size()==0) return -1;
        int lo = 0, hi = nums.size() - 1;
        while (lo < hi)
        {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo)/2;
            if((nums[mid]-nums[nums.size()-1])*(target-nums[nums.size()-1])>0)
            {
                if(nums[mid] < target)
                    lo = mid + 1;
                else
                    hi = mid;
            }else if(target > nums[nums.size()-1])
                hi = mid; 
            else
                lo = mid + 1;
        }
        return nums[lo] == target ? lo : -1;      
    }
};
