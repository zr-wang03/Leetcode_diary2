# 38. Count and Say

* Medium
*   The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

    * `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
    * `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

    To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

    For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251"`:

    Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

### Solution - Recursion

Since the problem is given in a recursive way, we'll do it recursively. Note the push\_back('a') is to push in a char that will never be matched with the chars before but make sure the search index (i+1) will not go out of range.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        if (n==1){
            return "1";
        }
        string count=countAndSay(n-1);
        count.push_back('a');
        string say="";
        int len=count.size();
        int i=0;
        while (i<len-1){
            int count_num=1;
            while(count.at(i)==count.at(i+1)){
                i++;
                count_num++;
            }
            say.append(to_string(count_num));
            say.push_back(count[i]);
            i++;
        }
        return say;
    }
};
