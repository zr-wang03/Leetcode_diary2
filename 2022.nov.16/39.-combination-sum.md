# 39. Combination Sum

* Medium
*   Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

    The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

    The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [[2,2,3],[7]]
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong>2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
    7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
    These are the only two combinations.</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code>Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]</code></pre>

    **Example 3:**

    <pre><code>Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> []</code></pre>

### Solution - Backtracking

Backtrack seems to fit to this problem well. After adding a new element to our curr(denoting current combination) vector, we are going to have a new target to meet.&#x20;

Note: While in the examples all the cases are given in ascending order, it is not always like that in the test cases. So to make that time-saving loop in the helper function work, we need to sort the candidate vector at the start.&#x20;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {  
        vector<vector<int>> answer;
        vector<int> temp;
        sort(candidates.begin(),candidates.end());
        helper(answer,candidates,temp,0,target);
        return answer;
    }
    
    void helper(vector<vector<int>>& answer, vector<int>& candidates, vector<int> curr, int index, int target){
        if (target<candidates[index]){
            return;
        }
        for (int i=index;i<candidates.size();i++){
            curr.push_back(candidates[i]);
            if (target==candidates[i]){
                answer.push_back(curr);
            }else{
                helper(answer,candidates,curr,i,target-candidates[i]);
            }
            curr.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
