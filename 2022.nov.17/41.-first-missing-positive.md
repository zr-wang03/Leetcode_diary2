# 41. First Missing Positive

* Hard
*   Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

    You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses constant extra space.

### Solution&#x20;

To explain how to came up with the solution, I am pasting the hints given by leetcode here.&#x20;

1. Think about how you would solve the problem in non-constant space. Can you apply that logic to the existing space?
2. We don't care about duplicates or non-positive integers
3. Remember that O(2n) = O(n)

So, what is the solution using non-constant space? A map that records if a digit has been seen or not, then we go through that map to find the first digit that has not yet been seen.&#x20;

Now, since we don't care about duplicates or non-positive integers, there are some spaces in the vector that is spare, and how can we use them? The answer is to use the original vector as the map. In the first round, we try to move all the digits to the correct place. Since we only care about positive integers, we always have an index from 0 to n that corresponds to it. And in the second round, we look for the places where the correct value is not in it. And that is where our O(2n) comes from.&#x20;

    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums)

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++ i)
            while(nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i])
                swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++ i)
            if(nums[i] != i + 1)
                return i + 1;
        
        return n + 1;
    }
};
