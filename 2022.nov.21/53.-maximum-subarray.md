# 53. Maximum Subarray

* Medium&#x20;
*   Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray which has the largest sum and return _its sum_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 6
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.</code></pre>

### Solution - Sliding window

We can apply sliding window here. As long as the sum we are looking at is positive, it is always going to be better to add this to the next value we see than we just look at the next number, therefore we only need to move the right pointer.&#x20;

However when the current sum is negative, we might as well throw them away and just look at the new value. So in this case we will move the left pointer and change the current sum to 0.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left=0;
        int right=0;
        int curr_max=INT_MIN;
        int curr_sum=0;
        while (right<nums.size()){
            curr_sum+=nums[right];
            if (curr_sum>curr_max){
                curr_max=curr_sum;
            }
            
            if (curr_sum<0){
                left=right;
                curr_sum=0;
            }
            right++;
        }
        return curr_max;
    }
};
```
