# 55. Jump Game

* Medium
*   You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

    Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> true
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code>Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> false
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.</code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

Not sure if this is greedy or dp, but the idea is simple. We keep record of what is the furthest position we can currently reach in the list as we traverse it. As long as we reach a position that cannot be reached from the previous spots, we know we cannot reach the end.

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int curr_max=0;
        for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if (curr_max<i){
                return false;
            }
            //cout<<"reaching:"<<nums[i]+i<<endl;
            
            if (nums[i]+i>curr_max){
                curr_max=nums[i]+i;
                //cout<<curr_max<<endl;
            }
        }
        if (curr_max>=n-1){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```
