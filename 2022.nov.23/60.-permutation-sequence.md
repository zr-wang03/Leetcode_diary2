# 60. Permutation Sequence

* Hard&#x20;
*   The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

    By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

    1. `"123"`
    2. `"132"`
    3. `"213"`
    4. `"231"`
    5. `"312"`
    6. `"321"`

    Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: n = 3, k = 3
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> "213"</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code>Input: n = 4, k = 9
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> "2314"</code></pre>

    **Example 3:**

    <pre><code>Input: n = 3, k = 1
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> "123"</code></pre>

### Solution - MATH

I guess this is where learning ECE241 helps in software. When we are looking at permutation, we are looking at something like a counter. Now let's take a example:

Let's say we want n=4, k=9.&#x20;

Now if the four digits starts with 1, then we have 3!=6 possibilities, which are "1234","1243","1324","1342","1423","1432".&#x20;

Now 9-6=3 and 3 is less then 6. So the permutation we are looking for starts with 2.&#x20;

So now the problem becomes find the 3rd permutation with \[1,3,4].&#x20;

Similarly, with the first digit fixed, we have 2! possibilities. So 3-2=1 , 1<2. The second digit we are looking for here will be the 2nd in the list: 3.

Now the problem becomes smaller and smaller. We are just looking for the 1st permutation with \[1,4]. Here the result is 1.&#x20;

So the overall result is 2314.&#x20;

    string getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> nums;
        for (int i=1;i<n+1;i++){
            nums.push_back(i);
        }
        
        string answer="";
        int curr_cycle=factorial(n-1);
        int index_number=0;
        
        k=k-1;
        for (int i=n;i>1;i--){
            index_number=k/curr_cycle;
            answer.append(to_string(nums[index_number]));
            k=k-index_number*curr_cycle;
            curr_cycle=curr_cycle/(i-1);
            nums.erase(nums.begin()+index_number);
        }
        answer.append(to_string(nums[0]));
        return answer;
    }
    
    
    int factorial(int n){
        if (n==0){
            return 1;
        }
        return n*(factorial(n-1));
    }
};
