# 63. Unique Paths II

* Medium
*   You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

    An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

    Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

    The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

### Solution

Instead of going from the right bottom corner back up, we are going in the opposite direction this time. Shouldn't be any difference.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& oG) {
        int m=oG.size();
        int n=oG[0].size();
        int dp[m][n];
        dp[0][0]=1;
        if (oG[0][0]==1){
            return 0;
        }
        for (int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for (int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if (oG[i][j]==1 || (i == 0 && j == 0)){
                    dp[i][j]=0;
                }else{
                    dp[i][j]=(i>0?dp[i-1][j]:0)+(j>0?dp[i][j-1]:0);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
        
    }
};
```
