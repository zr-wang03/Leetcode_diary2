# 66. Plus One

* Easy
*   You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

    Increment the large integer by one and return _the resulting array of digits_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: digits = [1,2,3]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [1,2,4]
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> The array represents the integer 123.
    Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
    Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].</code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code>Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [4,3,2,2]
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> The array represents the integer 4321.
    Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
    Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].</code></pre>

    **Example 3:**

    <pre><code>Input: digits = [9]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> [1,0]
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> The array represents the integer 9.
    Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
    Thus, the result should be [1,0].</code></pre>

### Solution

The whole problem is about carry-ons. Another thing to consider is the possibility that the current size of the array is not enough. Say 999+1=1000. So now we need to increase the size by one. However this only happens with all 9s and the result is always 1 with a bunch of 0s. So if that is the case, we just push a 0 back and change the first digit to 1.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
      int n = digits.size() - 1;
      
      for (int i = n; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (digits[i] == 9) {  
          digits[i] = 0;
        } else {  
          digits[i] += 1;
          return digits;
        }
      }
      digits.push_back(0);
      digits[0] = 1;
      return digits;
    }
};
```
