# 69. Sqrt(x)

* Easy
*   Given a non-negative integer `x`, return _the square root of_ `x` _rounded down to the nearest integer_. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

    You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

    * For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: x = 4
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 2
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.</code></pre>

### Solution -Binary Search

A binary search will solve the problem because we are looking for something that after being squared will result in itself. Therefore we have a way to compare it with our target.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0)
            return 0;
        int left = 1, right = x;
        while (true) {
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if (mid > x/mid) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                if (mid + 1 > x/(mid + 1))
                    return mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
