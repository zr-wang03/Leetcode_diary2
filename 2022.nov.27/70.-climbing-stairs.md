# 70. Climbing Stairs

* Easy
*   You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

    Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: n = 2
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 2
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> There are two ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps</code></pre>

### Solution - DP

This is a bottom up DP problem where the number of ways to the nth stair is the sum of the n-1th and the n-2th.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n==1){
            return 1;
        }
        int temp[n];
        
        temp[0]=1;
        temp[1]=2;
        for (int i=2;i<n;i++){
            temp[i]=temp[i-1]+temp[i-2];
        }
        return temp[n-1];
    }
};
```
