# 71. Simplify Path

* Medium
*   Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

    In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

    The **canonical path** should have the following format:

    * The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
    * Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
    * The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
    * The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

    Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: path = "/home/"
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> "/home"
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.</code></pre>

### Solution - Stringstream

The stringstream in C++ is a great help in solving this problem.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        string result="", token;
        stringstream ss(path);
        vector<string> tokens;
        while(getline(ss, token, '/')){
            if(token=="." || token=="") continue;
            else if(token==".."){
                if(tokens.size()!=0)  tokens.pop_back();
            }
            else tokens.push_back(token);
        }
        if(tokens.size()==0) return "/";
        for(int i=0; i<tokens.size(); ++i)
            result=result+'/'+tokens[i];
        return result;
    }
};
```
