# 72. Edit Distance

* Hard
*   Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`_.

    You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

    * Insert a character
    * Delete a character
    * Replace a character

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 3
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> 
    horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
    rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
    rose -> ros (remove 'e')</code></pre>

### Solution - DP

To build the DP solution, we first look at the base cases. For dp\[i]\[0], we are matching a array of length i to an array of length 0, so we need to delete i times. Similarly, for dp\[0]\[j], we need to insert j times.&#x20;

Then, if we have two digits that matches in the strings(at i-1 and j-1 in the arrays), then dp\[i]\[j]=dp\[i-1]\[j-1]. Otherwise, we choose the one operation from insert, delete and replace that gives the least cost.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
