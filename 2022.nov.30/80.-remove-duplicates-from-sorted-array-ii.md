# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

    Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

    Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

    Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

### Solution

The key to this solution is that we don't care about what the array looks like after the k elements. So we just have to move the correct ones to the first k elements. We'll keep a index to record the number of values that is valid till now, then whenever we meet a new valid value, we will move it to the index place and increase the index by one.&#x20;

```
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int index=0;
        for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if (index<2 || nums[i]>nums[index-2]){
                nums[index]=nums[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
};
```
