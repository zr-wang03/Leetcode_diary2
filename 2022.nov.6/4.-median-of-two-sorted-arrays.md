# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

* Hard
*   Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

    The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.
*   **Example 1:**

    <pre><code>Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 2.00000
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.</code></pre>



    <pre><code>Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
    <strong>Output:
    </strong> 2.50000
    <strong>Explanation:
    </strong> merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.</code></pre>

### Solution

The question asked for a run time complexity of O( log( m+n ) ), which somehow seems to be pointing to binary search. &#x20;

We will start with the brute force solution. Since we are looking for the median value, we can start by separting the set of numbers into two groups: the ones less or equal to the median, we name it Group I, and the ones that are larger than the median, calling them Group II. With the size of the set being m+n, we know that each group will always have (m+n)/2 numbers (+1 for odd total number).&#x20;

Now suppose I take a slice at index k in nums1 and claim that the k number to the left of this point belong to Group I, we would know that the ( ( m + n + 1 ) / 2 - k ) numbers counting from the left of the second array will also be in Group II, we call this value k2.

So, how do we prove that the slice is in the correct place? We need to check the maximum values in Group I and see if they are smaller than the minimum values in Group II. The good news is that the two arrays are already sorted, therefore the following two statements always stand nums1\[k]\<nums1\[k+1] and nums2\[k2]\<nums2\[k2+1]. Now, this means all we need to check is whether nums2\[k2] < nums1\[k+1] and nums1\[k] < nums2\[k2+1].&#x20;



With the cirtieria settled, we can start on how we will choose the place of slicing. The brute force way is to randomly choose the value k and move it to the left/right by one place according to the calculation in each round.  If we see that nums2\[k2] > nums1\[k+1], we know that the smallest value in the second part of nums1 is too small, meaning that our current slice k is to the left of the correct place, so we move to the right. Similarly, if nums1\[k] > nums2\[k2+1], we move k to the left. Note that k2 is a value calculated given the value of k, so k is the only one we are moving. &#x20;



Now if you think about it, when doing this, we are actually finding an index in an sorted array that satisfies some requirement, therefore we can apply binary search to make this faster. &#x20;
