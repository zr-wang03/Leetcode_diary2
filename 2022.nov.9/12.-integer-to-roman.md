# 12. Integer to Roman

* Medium
*   Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

    ```
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
    ```

    For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    * `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.&#x20;
    * `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.&#x20;
    * `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

    Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

        return ths[num/1000] + hrns[(num%1000)/100] + tens[(num%100)/10] + ones[num%10];
    }
