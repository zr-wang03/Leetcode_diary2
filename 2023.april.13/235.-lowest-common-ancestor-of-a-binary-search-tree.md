# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

* Medium
*   Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

    According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
    </strong><strong>Output: 6
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution - Recursion

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if ((root -> val > p -> val) && (root -> val > q -> val)) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root -> left, p, q);
        }
        if ((root -> val < p -> val) && (root -> val < q -> val)) {
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root -> right, p, q);
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
