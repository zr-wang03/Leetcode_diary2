# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

* Medium
*   Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

    According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

    <pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
    </strong><strong>Output: 3
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode * dfsTraverse(TreeNode * root, TreeNode * p , TreeNode * q)
    {
        if( root == p || root == q || root == NULL)
            return root;
        TreeNode * parent1 = dfsTraverse(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode * parent2 = dfsTraverse(root->right, p, q);
        if( parent1 && parent2)
            return root;
        else
            return parent1 ? parent1:parent2;
    }
    
    TreeNode * lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode * root, TreeNode * p, TreeNode * q)
    {
        return dfsTraverse(root, p, q);
    }
};
```
