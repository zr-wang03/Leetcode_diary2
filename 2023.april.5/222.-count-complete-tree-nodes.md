# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

* Medium
*   Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

    According to [**Wikipedia**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_tree#Types\_of\_binary\_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

    Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

    <pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    </strong><strong>Output: 6
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution - Recursive

```cpp
class Solution {

public:

    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {

        if(!root) return 0;

        int hl=0, hr=0;

        TreeNode *l=root, *r=root;

        while(l) {hl++;l=l->left;}

        while(r) {hr++;r=r->right;}

        if(hl==hr) return pow(2,hl)-1;

        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);

    }

};
```
