# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

* Easy
*   You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

    Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    </strong><strong>Output: 5
    </strong><strong>Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    </strong>Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
    </code></pre>

public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int maxPro = 0;
        int minPrice = INT_MAX;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++){
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            maxPro = max(maxPro, prices[i] - minPrice);
        }
        return maxPro;
    }
};
