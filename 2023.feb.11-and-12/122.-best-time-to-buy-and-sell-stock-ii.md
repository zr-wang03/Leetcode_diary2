# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

* Medium
*   You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

    On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

    Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    </strong><strong>Output: 7
    </strong><strong>Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    </strong>Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
    Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
    </code></pre>

### Solution - DP

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
        // It is impossible to sell stock on first day, set -infinity as initial value for curHold
        int curHold = INT_MIN, curNotHold = 0;
        
        for( const int stockPrice : prices ){
            
            int prevHold = curHold, prevNotHold = curNotHold;
            
            // either keep hold, or buy in stock today at stock price
            curHold = max( prevHold, prevNotHold - stockPrice );
            
            // either keep not-hold, or sell out stock today at stock price
            curNotHold = max( prevNotHold, prevHold + stockPrice );
        }
        
        // Max profit must come from notHold state finally.
        return curNotHold;
    }
};
```
