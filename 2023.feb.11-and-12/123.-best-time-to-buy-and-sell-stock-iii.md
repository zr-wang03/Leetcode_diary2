# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

* Hard
*   You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

    Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

    **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
    </strong><strong>Output: 6
    </strong><strong>Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
    </strong>Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
    </code></pre>

### Solution - DP

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        else {
            int K = 2; // number of max transation allowed
            int maxProf = 0;
            vector<vector<int>> f(K+1, vector<int>(prices.size(), 0));
            for (int kk = 1; kk <= K; kk++) {
                int tmpMax = f[kk-1][0] - prices[0];
                for (int ii = 1; ii < prices.size(); ii++) {
                    f[kk][ii] = max(f[kk][ii-1], prices[ii] + tmpMax);
                    tmpMax = max(tmpMax, f[kk-1][ii] - prices[ii]);
                    maxProf = max(f[kk][ii], maxProf);
                }
            }
            return maxProf;
        }
    }
