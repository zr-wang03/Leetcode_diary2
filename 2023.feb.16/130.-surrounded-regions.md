# 130. Surrounded Regions

* Medium
*   Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

    A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

    <pre><code><strong>Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
    </strong><strong>Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
    </strong><strong>Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
    </strong>- It is on the border, or
    - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
    The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
    The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

### Solution - DFS&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void DFS(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        if(i<0 or j<0 or i>=m or j>=n or board[i][j] != 'O') return;
        board[i][j] = '#';
        DFS(board, i-1, j, m, n);
        DFS(board, i+1, j, m, n);
        DFS(board, i, j-1, m, n);
        DFS(board, i, j+1, m, n);
    }
    
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
      
     
      
     int m = board.size();
        
      if(m == 0) return;  
        
     int n = board[0].size();
     
     for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {
         if(board[i][0] == 'O')
             DFS(board, i, 0, m, n);
         if(board[i][n-1] == 'O')
             DFS(board, i, n-1, m, n);
     }
         
     for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
         if(board[0][j] == 'O')
             DFS(board, 0, j, m, n);
         if(board[m-1][j] == 'O')
             DFS(board, m-1, j, m, n);
     }
        
     for(int i=0; i<m; i++)
         for(int j=0; j<n; j++)
         {
             if(board[i][j] == 'O')
                 board[i][j] = 'X';
             if(board[i][j] == '#')
                 board[i][j] = 'O';
         }
    }
};
