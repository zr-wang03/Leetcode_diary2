* Hard
*   There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

    You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

    * Each child must have at least one candy.
    * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

    Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
        int candy(vector<int> &a)
        {
            int i, x, sum = 0, n = a.size();
            vector<int> b(n, 1);
            for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
            {
                if (a[i] > a[i - 1])
                    b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1;
            }
            for (i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
            {
                if (a[i] > a[i + 1] && b[i] <= b[i + 1])
                    b[i] = b[i + 1] + 1;
            }
            for (auto x: b)
                sum += x;
            return sum;
        }
};
