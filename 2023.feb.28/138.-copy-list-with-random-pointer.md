# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

* Medium
*   A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

    Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_copying#Deep\_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

    For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

    Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

    The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

    * `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
    * `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

    Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

### Solution - MAP

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        map<Node*, Node*> m;
        int i=0;
        Node* ptr = head;
        while (ptr) {
            m[ptr] =new Node(ptr->val);
            ptr = ptr->next;
        }
        ptr = head;
        while (ptr) {
            m[ptr]->next = m[ptr->next];
            m[ptr]->random = m[ptr->random];
            ptr = ptr->next;
        }
        return m[head];
    }
};
```
