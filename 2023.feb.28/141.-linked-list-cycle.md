# 141. Linked List Cycle

* Easy
*   Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

    There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

    Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    </strong><strong>Output: true
    </strong><strong>Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
    </strong></code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    </strong><strong>Output: true
    </strong><strong>Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution - Two pointers

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if(head == NULL)
            return false;
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;

        while(fast != NULL && fast ->next != NULL)
        {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            
            if(fast == slow)
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```
