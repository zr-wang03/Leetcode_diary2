# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

* Easy
*   Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

    The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

    **Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

### Solution - Recursion

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode *root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        if(!root->left) return 1 + minDepth(root->right);
        if(!root->right) return 1 + minDepth(root->left);
        return 1+min(minDepth(root->left),minDepth(root->right));
    }
};
```
