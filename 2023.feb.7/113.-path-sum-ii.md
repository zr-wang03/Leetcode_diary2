# 113. Path Sum II

* Medium
*   Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return _all **root-to-leaf** paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals_ `targetSum`_. Each path should be returned as a list of the node **values**, not node references_.

    A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

### Solution - Recursion

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        vector<vector<int> > paths;
        vector<int> path;
        findPaths(root, sum, path, paths);
        return paths;  
    }
private:
    void findPaths(TreeNode* node, int sum, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int> >& paths) {
        if (!node) return;
        path.push_back(node -> val);
        if (!(node -> left) && !(node -> right) && sum == node -> val)
            paths.push_back(path);
        findPaths(node -> left, sum - node -> val, path, paths);
        findPaths(node -> right, sum - node -> val, path, paths);
        path.pop_back();
    }
};
```
