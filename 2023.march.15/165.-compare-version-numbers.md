# 165. Compare Version Numbers

* Medium
*   Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

    * Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.
    * To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

    _Return the following:_

    * If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
    * If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
    * Otherwise, return `0`.

### Solution - Stringstream

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
        istringstream v1(version1);
        istringstream v2(version2);

        while(!v1.eof() || !v2.eof())
        {
            string s1 = "0",s2 = "0";
            if(!v1.eof())
                getline(v1,s1,'.');

            if(!v2.eof())
                getline(v2,s2,'.');

            int n1 = atoi(s1.c_str());
            int n2 = atoi(s2.c_str());
            if(n1 == n2) continue;
            
            return (n1 > n2) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
