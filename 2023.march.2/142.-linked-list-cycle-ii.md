# 142. Linked List Cycle II

* Medium
*   Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

    There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

    **Do not modify** the linked list.

    <pre><code><strong>Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    </strong><strong>Output: tail connects to node index 1
    </strong><strong>Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        ListNode *slow  = head;
        ListNode *fast  = head;
        ListNode *entry = head;
        
        while (fast->next && fast->next->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast) {                      
                while(slow != entry) {               
                    slow  = slow->next;
                    entry = entry->next;
                }
                return entry;
            }
        }
        return NULL;                                 
    }
};
```
