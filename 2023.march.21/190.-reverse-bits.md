# 190. Reverse Bits

* Easy
*   Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

    **Note:**

    * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
    * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's\_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
    </strong><strong>Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    uint32_t  reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
        uint32_t result= 0;
        for(int i=0; i<32; i++)
            result = (result<<1) + (n>>i &1);
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
