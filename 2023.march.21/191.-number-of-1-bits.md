# 191. Number of 1 Bits

* Easy
*   Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming\_weight)).

    **Note:**

    * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
    * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's\_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
    </strong><strong>Output: 3
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        while (n) {
            n &= (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```
