# 200. Number of Islands

* Medium
*   Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

    An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: grid = [
    </strong>  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","0","0"]
    ]
    <strong>Output: 1
    </strong></code></pre>

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = m ? grid[0].size() : 0, islands = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    eraseIslands(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;
    }
private:
    void eraseIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        if (i < 0 || i == m || j < 0 || j == n || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        eraseIslands(grid, i - 1, j);
        eraseIslands(grid, i + 1, j);
        eraseIslands(grid, i, j - 1);
        eraseIslands(grid, i, j + 1);
