# 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

* Medium
*   Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return _the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: left = 5, right = 7
    </strong><strong>Output: 4
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

Note that as long as there is an increase by one, the last digit (LSB) goes from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. In that case the AND result of that bit is 0. Therefore we can use a recursive approach decreasing the length of the integer by one per round.&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        return (n > m) ? (rangeBitwiseAnd(m/2, n/2) << 1) : m;
    }
};
```
