# 202. Happy Number

* Easy
*   Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

    A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

    * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    * Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
    * Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

    Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: n = 19
    </strong><strong>Output: true
    </strong><strong>Explanation:
    </strong>12 + 92 = 82
    82 + 22 = 68
    62 + 82 = 100
    12 + 02 + 02 = 1
    </code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_map<int,int> tmp;
        
        while(n != 1)
        {
            if(tmp[n] == 0)
                tmp[n]++;
            else
                return false;
            
            int sum = 0;
            while(n != 0)
            {
                sum += pow(n % 10,2);
                n = n / 10;
            }
            
            n = sum;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
