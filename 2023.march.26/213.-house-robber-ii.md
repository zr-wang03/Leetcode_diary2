# 213. House Robber II

* Medium
*   You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

    Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,3,2]
    </strong><strong>Output: 3
    </strong><strong>Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
    </strong></code></pre>

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(); 
        if (n < 2) return n ? nums[0] : 0;
        return max(robber(nums, 0, n - 2), robber(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }
private:
    int robber(vector<int>& nums, int l, int r) {
        int pre = 0, cur = 0;
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            int temp = max(pre + nums[i], cur);
            pre = cur;
            cur = temp;
        }
