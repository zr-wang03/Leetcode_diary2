# 151. Reverse Words in a String

* Medium
*   Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

    A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

    Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

    Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: s = "the sky is blue"
    </strong><strong>Output: "blue is sky the"
    </strong></code></pre>

    **Example 2:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: s = "  hello world  "
    </strong><strong>Output: "world hello"
    </strong><strong>Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution - Stringstream

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        vector<string> words;
        stringstream ss(s);
        string tmp;
        while (ss >> tmp)
            words.push_back(tmp);

        string ans;
        for (int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (i != words.size() - 1) ans += " ";
            ans += words[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
