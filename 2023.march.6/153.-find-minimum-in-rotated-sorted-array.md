# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

* Medium
*   Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

    * `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
    * `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

    Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

    Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
    </strong><strong>Output: 1
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution - "Binary"

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
     int findMin(vector<int> &num) {
        int start=0,end=num.size()-1;
        
        while (start<end) {
            if (num[start]<num[end])
                return num[start];
            
            int mid = (start+end)/2;
            
            if (num[mid]>=num[start]) {
                start = mid+1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return num[start];
    }
};
```
