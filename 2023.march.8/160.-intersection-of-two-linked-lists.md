# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

* Easy
*   Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

    For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

    The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

    **Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

    **Custom Judge:**

    The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

    * `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
    * `listA` - The first linked list.
    * `listB` - The second linked list.
    * `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
    * `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

    The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160\_example\_1\_1.png)

    <pre><code><strong>Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
    </strong><strong>Output: Intersected at '8'
    </strong><strong>Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
    </strong>From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
    - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) 
    {
        ListNode *p1 = headA;
        ListNode *p2 = headB;
            
        if (p1 == NULL || p2 == NULL) return NULL;

        while (p1 != NULL && p2 != NULL && p1 != p2) {
            p1 = p1->next;
            p2 = p2->next;

            if (p1 == p2) return p1;

            //
            // If one of them reaches the end earlier then reuse it 
            // by moving it to the beginning of other list.
            // Once both of them go through reassigning, 
            // they will be equidistant from the collision point.
            //
            if (p1 == NULL) p1 = headB;
            if (p2 == NULL) p2 = headA;
        }
            
        return p1;
    }
};
```
