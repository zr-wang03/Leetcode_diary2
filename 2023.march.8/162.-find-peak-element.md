# 162. Find Peak Element

* Medium
*   A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

    Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

    You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

    **Example 1:**

    <pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    </strong><strong>Output: 2
    </strong><strong>Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
    </strong></code></pre>

### Solution&#x20;

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(const vector<int> &num) {
        return Helper(num, 0, num.size()-1);
    }
    
    int Helper(const vector<int> &num, int low, int high)
    {
        if(low == high)
            return low;
        else
        {
            int mid1 = (low+high)/2;
            int mid2 = mid1+1;
            if(num[mid1] > num[mid2])
                return Helper(num, low, mid1);
            else
                return Helper(num, mid2, high);
        }
    }
};
```
