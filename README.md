## Readme

The second part of my leetcode diary, starting on Nov 1st 2022.

I have just started C++ programming this semester and I decided to improve my C++ programming abilities using leetcode as a tool. Therefore, for the beginning of this diary, what I am about to do is to implement some of the algorithms I wrote last year using C++ and see if I can come up with a better idea than the ones I had last year.

Good luck to me!
